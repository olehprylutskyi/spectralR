### Spectral reflectance visualisations for user-defined areas

See our [vignette](https://olehprylutskyi.github.io/spectralR/) for
detailed usage examples.

## Description

This package provides tools for obtaining, processing, and visualization
of satellite-derived spectral reflectance data for the user-defined
polygons of earth surface classes, allowing to explore visually in which
wavelengths the classes differ. Input should be a shapefile with
polygons of surface classes (it might be polygons of different habitat
types, crops, or any other things). We use **Sentinel2 L2A** satellite mission 
(only optical bands) as a source of spectral reflectance data,
obtained through the **Google Earth Engine** service.

The workflow depends on `rgee` R package, which provides a bridge
between **R** and **Python** API for **Google Earth Engine**. All the
operations with satellite images run in a cloud, and the obtained pixel data 
is visualized locally afterward. Therefore, the most resource-hungry operations 
do not overload your local machine despite the extent of input data. 
But that means that you need a stable Internet connection for using API.

The overall workflow is following:

1.  Load the userâ€™s ESRI shapefile containing polygons for user-defined
    surface classes, as well as the text or numerical field with classes
    names (labels).

2.  Apply rgee functionality to retrieve multi-band pixel data for
    classes polygons from the Google Earth Engine service.

3.  Visualize retrieved pixel data locally, mainly using ggplot2
    approach.

Essential requirements:

-   stable Internet connection (for using API)

-   Installed and correctly pre-configured Python environment (v. 3.5 or
    above)

-   valid Google Earth Engine account

## Installation

Install the released version from CRAN

``` r
install.packages("spectralR")
```

You can install the development version of `spectralR` like so:

``` r
library(remotes)
install_github("olehprylutskyi/spectralR")
```

`spectralR` is strongly depends on `rgee` and `sf` packages, so install
and configure them before installing `spectralR`. More details in the
[vignette](https://olehprylutskyi.github.io/spectralR/).
